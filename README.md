Drink recipe website using Houndify.

To reproduce this website's functionality, you will need to use your own client ID and key in the App.js (line 43) and server.js (lines 19 and 20) files.

After pressing the microphone button, ask for your drink of preference.

In the example below, the question asked was "How do I make a Manhattan?" (Chrome's developer tools shows the question and Houndify's response)
